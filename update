Library card;

would be a cool tool to make, to derive. 

A library card that works to connect one with his community. creates a profile, shares collections, contents,
programs, contributions. One can contribute to the library. The library is a non-profit that one can engage with, help determine its future, its showcases, its design.

The library hosts projects, programs, collections made and run by its community. houses tools and resources for use.

Earthland library is a social writing/social work platform dedicated to serving its community, bringing life to works of art and innovation through mutual collaboration
and sponsorship. 




we will have an AI agent librarian that takes care of all of this stuff, that must be built. They will have a staff eventually too, once they are reuqired.
