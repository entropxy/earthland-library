Earthland Library is a powerful idea. 


I want to compile my own work and working projects into one singular place that I can hold as a digital archive.

That place is the Earthland Library.


Any project I am working on eventually will make its way in here.

Any old memories such as photos/videos, will make their way onto here.

I want this to be THE PLACE where my work lives.
